# simple-node-js-react-npm-app

This react app  repository  was forked and worked on by creating a jenkins pipeline then building and testing the forked react app

After a successful npm build and test, I created a dockerfile for the app and build it with docker 

Then I pushed it to dockerhub 

Then deployed the  react app docker image to production server using the jenkins pipeline.
